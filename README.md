So You Need a Typeface 2.0
==========================

https://ianli.github.io/so-you-need-a-typeface/

**So You Need a Typeface 2.0** is an interactive way to choose fonts for your projects.
It is a web recreation of the [infographic poster](http://www.julianhansen.com/#/zimmer/)
designed by [Julian Hansen](http://www.julianhansen.com/).

## Implementation

I recreated the poster into a dynamic web page using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The layout uses the [Blueprint CSS framework](http://www.blueprintcss.org/).

The Javascript libraries I used are:
* [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/1.4.3)
* [jQuery scrollTo](https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo/tree/1.4.3)
* [jQuery history](https://github.com/balupton/jquery-history/tree/v1.2)
